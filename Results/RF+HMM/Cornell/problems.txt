WRONG LABELS
------------
Subject #4, second trial of elev-up is actually a run trial.
Subject #15, in some cases of elev-up/down, the elevator seems to go both up and down.
All subjects: The activities are not well separated:
- A significant part of "elev-up" and "elev-down" contains a "stationary" state without the elevator moving. 
- In parts of walking, subjects are actucally stationary.

Subject 33
----------
Among subjects with gyro data, subject 33 is the only one that has the "treadmill" class, and therefore it cannot be used as a test subject in LOSO cross-validation.
